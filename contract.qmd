    # Project Overview

## Project Description:

A comprehencive view of the IOT network infrastructure during various types of network attacks e.g. DDOS, man in middle, Arp flood etc. Objective of the project is to monitor the behaviour of network parameters during a network attack vs normal traffic flow. The project will outline which parameters are effected during an active network attack e.g. during an arp flood the broadcast traffic which is icmp type of protocol will see high jump in fwd_pkts_tot/bwd_pkts_tot etc.
